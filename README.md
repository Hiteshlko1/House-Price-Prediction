# House-Price-Prediction

The Ames Housing [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) is taken from kaggle competition.

The aim of the project is to predict house price for houses in Boston Housing Dataset.
Two files, train and test are provided and the price of the test data is to be estimated.

## File descriptions

    train.csv - the training set
    test.csv - the test set
    data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
    sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms
